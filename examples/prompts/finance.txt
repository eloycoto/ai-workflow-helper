I need to create a workflow which checks the financial data for a list of companies and pushed to my service.

The input of the workflow will be like:

{"companies": ["IBM", "APPL"]}

For each company, the data can be get from the following url, where symbol is the company information:

curl -s "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo" | jq '."52WeekHigh"'

When you iterate to all the companies the output should be:

```
[
    {"company": "IBM", "high": $52WeekHighValue},
    {"company": "APPL", "high": $52WeekHighValue},
]
```
And this  result should be post to: "http://acalustra.com/financialData/post"
