I need to generate a workflow wich track room temperature for different rooms on my building.

The workflow should have an input with multiple rooms, in json array, like:

```
{"rooms": ["kitchen", "bedroom1", "bathroom"]}
```

for each room, you need to iterate over the array and make an http request to http://office-status.local/temperature/$ROOM. When you made all request, please create a json like

```
[
  { "room": "kitchen", "temperature": 23 },
  { "room": "bedroom1", "temperature": 18 },
  { "room": "bathroom", "temperature": 18 }
]
```

This json need to be posted into http://erp.local/roomTemperatures, using a POST request and all rooms information should be in a json object, with the key .rooms
